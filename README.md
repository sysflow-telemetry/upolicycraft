uIDS
====

An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for micro-services.

uIDS Workflow 
=============

uIDS is divided into three components, a build environment for producing a suitable binary for modeling, a micro execution framework for producing effect graphs for a container's binary, and the microservice-aware intrusion detection system (MIDS) for enforcing these effect graphs over lightweight container telemetry provided by SysFlow.
