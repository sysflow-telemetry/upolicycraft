syscalls
========

A BAP plugin for identifying system calls in a binary.

Micro-Execute a function in our fake libc.

    ../../plugins/syscalls/bin/run.sh ./libc.so branching

Build a model of `echo` using Call Graph search and Primus.
    (~20 minutes since it lifts glibc.)

    ../../../bin/model ./server

The file `model.json` shows its output.


## Making oasis aware of the plugin

    oasis setup -setup-update dynamic

Then

    make

and

    make (re)install

## Add the Plugin to BAP

    ./bin/build-plugin.sh

## Notes

A plugin can define observers that subscribe to events generated by providers
inside the Primus machine. After defining your machine, you can subscribe to
the observations you want sent to your machine.
