uIDS
====

Compute process behavior models from application binaries statically through micro-execution.

Extracting Container Images From Within uIDS
============================================

Running Passes
==============

Traversing a call graph with BAP from an entrypoint:

    bap binary --pass cg --cg-entrypoint "@main"


Experiments
===========

Comparing the Call Graph Generated by BAP using LLVM's Call Graph as Ground Truth.

    # Generate a Call Graph from a C file

    callgraph ./artifacts/server.c

    # Compare a Call Graph Generated by LLVM
    bap ./artifacts/server --pass cg --cg-dotfile ./callgraph.dot

Important Directories
=====================

## passes

BAP passes for our analysis. The `cg` pass implements our evaluation of BAP's
ability to generate Call Graphs.

## plugins

The main BAP plugin that collects system calls through micro-execution.
